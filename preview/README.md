# Real /app sidebar experiment branch

Edits on `test/app-sidebar` are made directly to the same `sites/_apex/app` HTML, CSS, and navigation module as the live workspace. This branch is never used for production deployment.

Every test-branch push deploys **only a static preview** to the existing Cloudflare Pages project on its non-production `app-sidebar-preview` branch. The actual /app document and styles are copied verbatim. Only the authenticated entrypoint is replaced with `preview-bootstrap.js`, which performs no account actions or network requests. All other controls except sidebar navigation are disabled.

Preview address: https://app-sidebar-preview.dofinances-studio.pages.dev/app/

The live site uses production branch `main`. The untouched baseline is saved as commit `7cced4fa98bac32261390cc256158eb2624a2ee3` and branch `backup/app-sidebar-before-experiments-20261108`. To discard an experiment, leave `main` untouched and abandon this branch.
